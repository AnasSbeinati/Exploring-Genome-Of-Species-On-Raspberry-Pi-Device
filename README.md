# Exploring-Genome-Of-Species-On-Raspberry-Pi-Device
A huge amount of data is produced daily by genome sequencing. It is kept in genome
banks which contain also precious biological information that is mostly not
discovered yet. Biologists in turn are keen to precisely explore these banks in order
to discover effective patterns that have a real impact on the function and evolution of
living Creatures. Therefore, it becomes very important to store this data
professionally to explore it in a frequent manner. Many techniques have emerged to
store genomes in the lowest possible space. Reference-based Compression
algorithms (RbCs) efficiently compress the sequenced genomes by mainly storing
their differences with respect to a reference genome. Therefore, RbCs give very high
compression ratios compared to the traditional compression algorithms. However, in
order to search a compressed genome for specific patterns, it has to be totally
decompressed, wasting both time and storage. Therefore, it becomes very critical to
professionally store this data in order to efficiently browse it in a frequent manner.
This is done by a device called Raspberry-Pi.
“Exploring the Genomes of Species on Raspberry-Pi Device” project is about
manipulating different species' genomes to facilitate the process of sending/receiving
multiple genomes and reduce the time needed to search/pick a certain sequence of
data of a certain genome. This is done by compressing multiple targets (versions)
genomes based on one reference (base) genome and then searching/browsing for a
certain sequence by partially decompressing the compressed genomes. The second
part of the algorithm shall enhance the previous one in order to work on more
advanced species and thus reduce the time needed and space required to deal with
such high chromosome count genomes. The overall program shall be tested and
deployed on Raspberry-Pi device.
